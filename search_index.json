[["index.html", "MNet Manual 1 OVERVIEW", " MNet Manual 2024-10-28 1 OVERVIEW The surge in metabolomics and transcriptomic data has necessitated the development of innovative network analysis tools for the integrated analysis of multi-omics data. However, current tools often focus on individual pathways, extracting the subnetwork for the interested genes and metabolites or extracting the correlation subnetwork, neglecting the valuable information embedded in gene-metabolite or metabolite-metabolite knowledge networks across all metabolic pathways. In response to this gap, we introduce an integrated analytical tool MNet, an R package for mining metabolomics coupled with clinical and transcriptomic data. MNet introduces three key feature to enhance the analytical capabilities： Knowledgebase - dbMNet: dbKEGG for extended pathway analysis and dbNet for metabolism-related subnetwork analysis Algorithm for extended pathway analysis: identify dysregulated metabolic pathways via considering both metabolites and genes Extended pathway enrichment analysis (EPEA) Extended differential abundance analysis (EDA) Extended data sets enrichment analysis (ESEA) Algorithm for metabolism-related subnetwork analysis: Maximising the potential of our well-established dnet algorithm in integrative analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic data to provide a systems-level understanding of metabolic interconnections MNet Installation if(!require(BiocManager)){ install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) } if (!require(remotes)) { BiocManager::install(&quot;remotes&quot;, dependencies=T) } if (!require(devtools)) { BiocManager::install(&quot;devtools&quot;, dependencies=T) } BiocManager::install(&quot;hfang-bristol/dnet&quot;, dependencies=T) BiocManager::install(&quot;tuantuangui/MNet&quot;, dependencies=T) ## Check the package ‘MNet’ successfully installed library(help=MNet) "],["input-and-output.html", "2 Input and output 2.1 Data input 2.2 Result output", " 2 Input and output 2.1 Data input The sample data comprises an integrated analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles in triple-negative breast cancer.

GeneExp Data: an interactive table for user-input metabolic data with rows corresponding to genes and columns correspond to the samples. Group Data: Group information. 2.2 Result output The analysis results can be output in image form in two formats: PDF and JPEG. The figure width, height and resolution(DPI) can be adjusted.
